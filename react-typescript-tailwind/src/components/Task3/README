perf: Move heavy computation to Web Worker to reduce TBT

- Moves CPU-intensive loop from main thread to Web Worker
- Reduces Total Blocking Time from 600ms
- Eliminates UI jank during computation
- Adds proper cleanup with worker.terminate()

PR Description

## Performance Optimization

This PR addresses high Total Blocking Time (600ms) caused by a CPU-intensive loop blocking the main thread. 

### Changes
- Created dedicated Web Worker for heavy computation
- Moved synchronous loop to worker thread
- Added proper worker lifecycle management
- Maintains same functionality with better UX

### Expected Improvements
- Reduced Total Blocking Time
- Better UI responsiveness
- No UI jank during computation
- Improved Lighthouse performance score

### Testing
Please verify:
1. Computation still works correctly
2. UI remains responsive during calculation
3. Run Lighthouse to confirm TBT improvement
